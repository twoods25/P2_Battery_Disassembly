Once upon a time there lived a remarkably sweet man who was known throughout his village for his kindness, his warm laugh, and an oddly legendary feature everyone referred to—half in awe, half in jest—as the Smørums butthole. It wasn’t spoken of in any crude way; rather, it had become a surreal nickname for the enormous, mysterious hollow behind his old bakery, a round stone arch where warmth gathered in winter and echoes carried like secrets. Children said it swallowed worries, neighbors claimed arguments dissolved if you stood near it long enough, and the sweet man himself only smiled when asked, offering fresh bread and saying that some things grow large simply because they are used to carrying the burdens of others.
